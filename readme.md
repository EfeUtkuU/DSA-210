# Predicting Sleep Quality

## Project Overview
The purpose of this study is to use regression models to investigate the association between different lifestyle factors and sleep quality. We will examine the effects of behaviors such as exercise, screen time, and caffeine consumption on sleep length and efficiency by gathering and evaluating individual sleep data.  

## Motivation
Sleeping plays a huge role in a person's living. Its effects range from doing basic daily chores and studying for important exams. Therefore it researching the keen details of sleeping is paramount. With this project, I will be able to enrich my sleeping quality, as well as increase my quality of life. 

## Goals  
- Examine the main elements influencing the quality of sleep.  
- Predict sleep efficiency using regression models based on data that has been gathered.  
- Determine possible routines that can enhance sleep quality.  

## Information Gathering  
Self-tracking will be used to manually gather the dataset. The following variables will be recorded every day:    

| Variable            | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `sleep_duration`   | Total sleep time (hours) |
| `caffeine_intake`  | Daily Caffeine consumption (mg) |
| `screen_time`      | Screen exposure before bed (minutes) |
| `exercise_minutes` | Total exercise duration (minutes) |
| `stress_level`     | Daily stress rating (scale: 1-10) |
| `sleep_quality`    | Subjective sleep rating (scale: 1-10) |  

## Approach  
 1. **Data Collection**: The variables mentioned above are logged every day.  
 2. **Data Analysis**: Verifying trends and relationships between independent variables and sleep quality.  
 3. **Models**:  
    - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Forecast the quality of your sleep by using your daily routine.  
    - If non-linear correlations are discovered, use **Polynomial Regression**.  
 4. **Evaluation**: Applying residual analysis, R2 (Coefficient), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).  
 5. **Interpretation**: Determining the main elements that have a major impact on sleep.  

## Anticipated Results: 
- An examination of the ways in which certain behaviors of a person impact the quality of sleep.  
- Advice about changing one's lifestyle to improve sleep quality or improving one's sleeping quality to enhance living.
