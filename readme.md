Effects of Daily Protein and Calorie Intake on Lifting Strength

What is this research about?

Majority of the people that do fitness tend to care about their diet since it plays a big part on how the body repairs itself and how the progression is seen on the body. Calorie and protein intake plays the major role on the progression of the strength therefore tracking the data that ensures this progression will yield the outcome of how exact these counterparts of diet affect the strength of one's body. As a result of the analysis, we will be able to predict the strength data that the user is expecting.

Motivation:

As a person that has a strong background of sports ranging from basketball to gymnastics, I currently am doing fitness to increase my body mass and strength. I would like to see the exact numbers of how much calorie and protein I have to take to match my idealized strength on certain fitness exercises.

Data Source:

I will be collecting my own protein and calorie intake for this month with supplementary examples from Kaggle and friends that concurrently doing fitness, as well as including my strength on certain exercises in 'Kg's.

Data Analysis:

Will be using pandas and MatPlotLib to visualize the data. Also will be using NumPy to do gradient descent algorithms on matrices in order to functionalize regression algorithms (probably will be using Polynomial Regression).

End Goal:

At the end of the data collection and Machine Learning algorithm design, I will be using the yielding functions to predict my idealized body mass and strength regarding the scope of my expected calorie and protein intake.
This research not only gives me the opportunity to better myself, it will also enlight other fitness people that are having hardships in reaching their goals.
